In this project we focus on the training of neural networks concerning the problem of sales data and economic indicators. 
"Many sales models starting returning less than stellar results during the Covid era, in part because the training data came from before the Covid period. In this project we are going to take several publically available data sets containing sales data and try to come up with the right mix of economic (and other) indicators that will make predictions as stable as possible across time, including the Covid period.
